<h1>Patriotic Foods</h1>

<p><img src="hotchocolate.gif" style="float: left; padding: 10px;"/>In the 1760s, Britain began to tax goods, including food, that Americans bought from overseas. To protest this tax, many Americans decided not to buy any more imported goods until the law was changed. That means many food items, like fancy tea sets or even tea itself, that came from Britain could not be purchased any more. By 1775, protest turned into a war between Britain and America. Serving food that was bought from or grown in American became a symbol of your support for the cause against Britain. </p>

<p>To show his support for the Revolution, Washington had to give up many of the foods he was used to, like English beer and butter. Even after the colonies won the war, Washington said "we have already been too long subject to British prejudices…I use no porter or chess in my family but such as is made in America.” For many colonists, tea was the biggest sacrifice and, instead, they had to drink hot chocolate or coffee if they wanted a hot beverage.</p>

<h1> Did you know?</h1>

<p style= "font-size: 14pt;"><img src="GeorgeWashingtonFact.gif" style="float: right"/>Washington's fellow Virginian, Thomas Jefferson, wrote the Declaration of Independence but he also made a declaration about food. Since Americans gave up tea, he knew Americans needed a new favorite drink. He predicted <i>hot chocolate</i> would be the new winner!</p>

<h2> Sounds delicious!</h2>
