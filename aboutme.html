<h1> About Me </h1>

<p><img style="float:left; align:bottom" src="Monticello.jpg" align: bottom/>I am an M.A. student in History at George Mason University. My primary interest is in the social and cultural history of the 18th and early 19th century South. I have worked at numerous historical sites in order to pursue my passion for historical research, interpretation and material culture. 

<p>The nitty-gritty of it is…history is my passion and I want others to be able enjoy and learn from our past too — whether it be through documents, museums or websites.</p> 

<p> This means you may see me in colonial-period clothing on any given weekend. </p>
