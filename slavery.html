<h1>Slavery at Mount Vernon</h1>
<h3>A Life Without Freedom</h3>

<p>Thousands of African and African-American people were enslaved throughout the colonies. Slaves often could not make money, do the jobs they wanted, live in the places they wished to or keep their families together. Most slaves in Virginia worked on large plantations, like Mount Vernon, among very hard conditions. Slaves who worked in the fields often tended to crops for hours with no rest, from sun up to sun down. </p>

<p>There were about 300 enslaved people who lived at Mount Vernon and many of them were involved in making sure the Washingtons were able to have food. Slaves worked in the fields to grow the crops or care for the animals. Other slaves would prepare, cook and serve the food during meal times. Despite this hard work, slaves often did not get to enjoy the food they made. Slaves received small rations from the Washingtons but, otherwise, they had to grow, cook, buy, or hunt their food on their own after a long day of difficult work. </p>
