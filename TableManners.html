<h1>Table Manners</h1>
<h3> Fancy Foods, Fancy Behavior</h3>

<p><img src="" style="float: left"/>Manners and hospitality—a word for how someone treats their guests—were very important to wealthy men, like Washington. Washington was expected to treat all guests—even strangers—with manners and, of course, food! All guests were treated to a drink but only the most honored guests were able to eat dinner with the Washingtons. The Washingtons were famous for the food they served. One guest said that Washington “gives diet [food] and lodging to all that come that way” to Mount Vernon. </p>

<p>At the dinner table, manners were just as important as the conversation. Showing everyone the right manners at the table and using all of the different utensils correctly told everyone that you had the time and money to learn such fancy habits. Imagine trying to tell the difference between a teacup, a coffee cup and a hot chocolate cup! It’s a lot of pressure, but the Washingtons and their guests had to use manners to show how educated and successful they were. </p>

<h2> How embarrassing!</h2>
